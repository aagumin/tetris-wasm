# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is currently empty (no source, tests, or assets checked in). As the project is bootstrapped, keep a simple layout such as:

- `src/` for game logic and UI
- `tests/` for automated tests
- `assets/` for sprites, audio, or fonts
- `docs/` for design notes or diagrams

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

No build or test tooling is configured yet. Once a toolchain is added, document the primary commands here (for example, `npm run dev`, `npm test`, or `make build`) with one-line explanations.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

No formatting or linting tools are defined yet. When introducing them, document:

- Indentation and file naming (e.g., 2 spaces, `kebab-case` filenames).
- Language-specific style rules and formatter/linter commands.

## Testing Guidelines

No testing framework is configured. When tests are added, document:

- The framework used (e.g., Jest, Vitest, Pytest).
- Test file naming patterns (e.g., `*.test.ts`) and where to place them.
- The command to run the full test suite.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

No commit history is present to infer conventions. Until a standard emerges:

- Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add line clear logic").
- Include a concise PR description, steps to verify, and screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.

## Configuration & Secrets

Do not commit secrets. If configuration files are introduced (e.g., `.env`), add an `.env.example` with safe defaults and document required variables here.
